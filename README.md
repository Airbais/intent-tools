# Airbais Tools

Welcome to Airbais, a company dedicated to helping businesses improve their presence and visibility in Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into how people search for information and make decisions, it's crucial for businesses to understand and optimize how they appear in these systems.

## Our Mission

Airbais provides practical tools and solutions to help businesses:
- Understand how LLMs interpret their content
- Optimize their digital presence for AI-driven discovery
- Measure and improve their visibility in AI-powered search and recommendations
- Ensure their brand message is accurately conveyed through AI interactions

## Intents

At Airbais we understand that the days of search keywords and SEO are fading fast. Now it's all about deeply understanding customer intents and communicating those intents to the LLMs. Language models and AI agents are all about interpreting what users are asking, and responding with the most relevant content. If you want your brand to appear as part of those responses, you must be able to align to the intent of the question being asked. Our tools are designed to help you do that so you can make the right content adjustments and insure that AI recommends your brand when the intents match. 

## Tools

You can then start to make informed decisions about whether those intents align to your expectations, and adjust accordingly.
