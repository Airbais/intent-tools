# Airbais Tools

Welcome to Airbais, a company dedicated to helping businesses improve their presence and visibility in Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into how people search for information and make decisions, it's crucial for businesses to understand and optimize how they appear in these systems.

## Our Mission

Airbais provides practical tools and solutions to help businesses:
- Understand how LLMs interpret their content
- Optimize their digital presence for AI-driven discovery
- Measure and improve their visibility in AI-powered search and recommendations
- Ensure their brand message is accurately conveyed through AI interactions

## Intents

At Airbais we understand that the days of search keywords and SEO are fading fast. Now it's all about deeply understanding customer intents and communicating those intents to the LLMs. Language models and AI agents are all about interpreting what users are asking, and responding with the most relevant content. If you want your brand to appear as part of those responses, you must be able to align to the intent of the question being asked. Our tools are designed to help you do that so you can make the right content adjustments and insure that AI recommends your brand when the intents match. 

## Tools

### IntentCrawler

Intentcrawler is our first tool that helps businesses understand how their _current_ website content is interpreted by LLMs and AI agents. Intentcrawler looks at your website and provides an interpretation of the intents that AI is seeing when it looks at your site. You can then start to make informed decisions about whether those intents align to your expectations, and adjust accordingly. This is just the first of many tools we're working on!

**Key Features:**
- **Intelligent Web Analysis**: Crawls your website respectfully while extracting the user intents conveyed to AI systems
- **Advanced Intent Discovery**: Uses machine learning techniques including topic modeling and semantic clustering to automatically discover what users are trying to accomplish on your site
- **LLM-Ready Outputs**: Generates summaries in the standardized llmstxt format for optimal AI comprehension
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize discovered intents, analyze site structure, and track changes over time
- **Actionable Insights**: Understand gaps between your intended message and what AI systems perceive

IntentCrawler helps you answer critical questions like:
- What do AI systems think my website is about?
- Which user intents are clearly communicated vs. missed?
- How can I improve my content structure for better AI understanding?
