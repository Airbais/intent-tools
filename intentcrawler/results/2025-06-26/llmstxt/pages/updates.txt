--- title FastMCP Updates - FastMCP sitename FastMCP date 2025-05-21 --- FastMCP 2.8 is here, and its all about taking control of your tools. This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience  Tool Transformation The headline feature lets you wrap any toolfrom your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI specto create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code. This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly put it, Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools.  Component Control Now that youre transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enabledisable any component, and for everyone whos been asking what FastMCPs tags are forthey finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.  Pragmatic by Default Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, weve made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, well restore the old default  but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!
