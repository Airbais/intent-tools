Moving to it has rarely been popular and is growing unfashionable nowadays we demand that the information come to us. This can be accomplished in three basic ways moving physical media around, broadcasting radiation through space, and sending signals through wires. This article is about what will, for a short time anyway, be the biggest and best wire ever made. Wires warp cyberspace in the same way wormholes warp physical space the two points at opposite ends of a wire are, for informational purposes, the same point, even if they are on opposite sides of the planet. The cyberspace-warping power of wires, therefore, changes the geometry of the world of commerce and politics and ideas that we live in. The financial districts of New York, London, and Tokyo, linked by thousands of wires, are much closer to each other than, say, the Bronx is to Manhattan. Today this is all quite familiar, but in the 19th century, when the first feeble bits struggled down the first undersea cable joining the Old World to the New, it must have made peoples hair stand up on end in more than just the purely electrical sense  it must have seemed supernatural.
