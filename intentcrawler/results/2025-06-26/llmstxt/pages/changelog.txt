--- title Changelog - FastMCP sitename FastMCP date 2010-02-02 --- FastMCP 2.9 introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol MCP Middleware and server-side type conversion. MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses at the protocol level, giving you powerful capabilities for logging, authentication, validation, and more. This is particularly useful for building production-ready MCP servers that need sophisticated request handling. This release also introduces server-side type conversion for prompt arguments, ensuring that data is properly formatted before being passed to your functions. This reduces the burden on individual tools and prompts to handle type validation and conversion. Full Changelog v2.8.1v2.9.0 2.8.1 introduces audio support, as well as minor fixes and updates for deprecated features. This release adds support for audio content in MCP tools and resources, expanding FastMCPs multimedia capabilities beyond text and images. Full Changelog v2.8.0v2.8.1 FastMCP 2.8.0 introduces powerful new ways to customize and control your MCP servers! The highlight of this release is first-class Tool Transformation, a new feature that lets you create enhanced variations of existing tools. You can now easily rename arguments, hide parameters, modify descriptions, and even wrap tools with custom validation or post-processing logicall without rewriting the original code. This makes it easier than ever to adapt generic tools for specific LLM use cases or to simplify complex APIs. Huge thanks to strawgate for partnering on this, starting with 591 and 599 and continuing offline. This release also gives you more granular control over which components are exposed to clients. With new tag-based filtering, you can selectively enable or disable tools, resources, and prompts based on tags, perfect for managing different environments or user permissions. Complementing this, every component now supports being programmatically enabled or disabled, offering dynamic control over your servers capabilities. Finally, to improve compatibility with a wider range of LLM clients, this release changes the default behavior for OpenAPI integration all API endpoints are now converted to Tools by default. This is a breaking change but pragmatically necessitated by the fact that the majority of MCP clients available today are, sadly, only compatible with MCP tools. Therefore, this change significantly simplifies the out-of-the-box experience and ensures your entire API is immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. Full Changelog v2.7.1v2.8.0 This release primarily contains a fix for parsing string tokens that are provided to FastMCP clients. Full Changelog v2.7.0v2.7.1 This is primarily a housekeeping release to remove or deprecate cruft thats accumulated since v1. Primarily, this release refactors FastMCPs internals in preparation for features planned in the next few major releases. However please note that as a result, this release has some minor breaking changes which is why its 2.7, not 2.6.2, in accordance with repo guidelines though not to the core user-facing APIs. Happily, this release DOES permit the use of naked decorators to align with Pythonic practice Full Changelog v2.6.2v2.7.0 This is a patch release to restore py.typed in 686. Full Changelog v2.6.0v2.6.1 Full Changelog v2.5.2v2.6.0 Full Changelog v2.5.1v2.5.2 This release introduces completely new tools for generating and customizing MCP servers from OpenAPI specs and FastAPI apps, including popular requests like mechanisms for determining what routes map to what MCP components renaming routes and customizing the generated MCP components. Context.sample for flexible model selection. by davenpi in 542Full Changelog v2.4.0v2.5.0 Note this release includes a backwards-incompatible change to how resources are prefixed when mounted in composed servers. However, it is only backwards-incompatible if users were running tests or manually loading resources by prefixed key LLMs should not have any issue discovering the new route. See Resource Prefix Formats for more.

Full Changelog v2.3.0v2.3.1 Full Changelog v2.2.10v2.3.0 Full Changelog v2.2.9v2.2.10 This release is a hotfix for the issue detailed in 330 Full Changelog v2.2.8v2.2.9 Full Changelog v2.2.7v2.2.8 Full Changelog v2.2.6v2.2.7 Full Changelog v2.2.5v2.2.6 Full Changelog v2.2.4v2.2.5 The wildcard URI templates exposed in v2.2.3 were blocked by a server-level check which is removed in this release. Full Changelog v2.2.3v2.2.4 Full Changelog v2.1.2v2.2.0 The main improvement in this release is a fix that allows FastAPI  OpenAPI-generated servers to be mounted as sub-servers. Full Changelog v2.1.1v2.1.2 FastMCPs docs are now available at gofastmcp.com. Full Changelog v2.1.0v2.1.1 The primary motivation for this release is the fix in 128 for Claude desktop compatibility, but the primary new feature of this release is per-object tags. Currently these are for bookkeeping only but will become useful in future releases. Full Changelog v2.0.0v2.1.0 Full Changelog v1.0v2.0.0 This release commemorates FastMCP 1.0, which is included in the official Model Context Protocol SDK To the best of my knowledge, v1 is identical to the upstream version included with mcp . Full Changelog v0.4.1v1.0 Full Changelog v0.4.0v0.4.1 This is a relatively small release in terms of features, but the version is bumped to 0.4 to reflect that the code is being relicensed from Apache 2.0 to MIT. This is to facilitate FastMCPs inclusion in the official MCP SDK. Full Changelog v0.3.5v0.4.0 This release is highlighted by the ability to handle complex JSON objects as MCP inputs and improved Windows compatibility.
